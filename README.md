My Doom Emacs config files. Some plugins for web development and a nice theme. 

To use, install Doom Emacs from instructions, then replace the files in ~/.doom.d with these ones.

Change my name and email in config.el to your name and email. Either create a directory ~/Documents/org for org mode files, or change that directory in config.el.

Run ~/.emacs.d/bin/doom sync 

Open and enjoy!
